FaceAuth was made in January 2012 by <a href="http://www.weberdevelopment.de/" target="_blank">Francois Weber</a>, student of Multimedia-Technology.
<p>
FaceAuth is the topic of my paper "<i>An alternative authentification method via Webcam</i>", which I am currently
writing for my University (<a href="http://www.fh-salzburg.ac.at/" target="_blank">University of Applied Sciences Salzburg</a>).
</p>
FaceAuth uses the <a href="http://www.face.com/" target="_blank">Face.com API</a> to recognize a face. The webcam is implemented in Actionscript 3 and makes use of the Face.com
<a href="http://www.meta-for.net/" >Actionscript 3 Library</a>.
